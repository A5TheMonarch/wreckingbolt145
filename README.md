TRS and Tactical Triumph, Life and all my struggles.

First up, I decided to get the idea of writing this page after seeing that Demofocus did his and shared it with me, and as am speaking I am currently on my leave in TSF. Here is how I managed to get my way into the team behind TRS.

# __The Beginnings and Background__

Prior to TRS, I had been on Roblox since the start of 2016 as a 7 year old and it has bought loads of memories since then however one day I saw a category called "Sports" and I immediately clicked on it and found games like TPS 16, RS16 (Robloxia Soccer which is now discontinued completely as of 2021), RES and so on and on. It made me feel like it was like FIFA but on Roblox as I would always play FIFA on my PlayStation 4 at the time. However during 2019-2020 there was a ro-football game that I full on mastered, SS: Soccer Reborn (made by the person who also made RF25) and during its time I netted over 2200 goals in game. Also towards the end of 2019 thats when I created the account "wreckingbolt145" having previously intending to use it as an alt however after I left primary school in 2020, I wanted to move on from the whole primary school era and decided to leave my account which I made in 2018 having lost the login details to my original account. As of today I have not touched the account since September 2020 and have left it there. In 2022 I managed to remember my first account login and I successful logged back in however due to vast progress I made in games using the account you all know me as, I decided to use the 2016 account as my alt. In terms of leagues my first real experience was ECL (English Conferences League) where I would spectate matches every week, however I was only 11 (yes) but I never spoke of my age or made it bait that im under 13.

# __Discovering TRS__

One day in July of 2022, having not played TPS for a long while I searched for it and stumbled across TRS: Public Pitch. I joined and started practicing and enjoyed the game, at the time I was 13 and then after that I joined the Tactical Triumph group and the Discord server, and really I did nothing as I was not even known to anyone, this was during the time when the dev team consisted of Demofocus, Fxx, NameJenuine, Double, Alfie, Seby and so on. They hosted scrims and stuff and I played in them but only had a few good moments as the TRS staff stole the show all the time. Then one day I decided to practice in my private server and then I got admin perms for it and I played around with the commands before discovering that you can host matches. From that point onwards I called people in public server to get them to play in scrims in my server and it was fun and all of that.

# __The first and second attempts of making TSF, The huge failure of Super Soccer and starting to take leagues on a serious note__

Tactical Triumph around December 2022 at the same time they delayed the Super Soccer update they made their own official league for TRS and I joined it where I trialled for numerous teams however unfortunately, the first TSF died and got discontinued for heavy inactivity and then from that point onwards I didn't do much I kept hosting my own scrims and whatnot and waited patiently for Super Soccer, also at this time I was inactive on Discord. However upon return in June 2023 the update was nearly done and then eventually got its release date of July 2023 and then finally the game was launched... Well I played it and I hated it. The tools were like Blue Lock and anime in general, and it was just filled with bugs all across no matter how many updates they did, the game remained shit. At that time I felt like TRS was gonna stay like that and having actually spent money on the game I decided that I was done with TRS. However they bought back the old game under "Legacy" but still it damaged my thoughts on the game to the point I literally made a bug report chatting the most shit and dissing the game so much and telling Demo to update Legacy which did not go down well with him. and then by August 2023 the second TSF came to existence and I got signed by a team however you know the story, died and discontinued. Also at the point I took leagues seriously I managed a team in a league that never even had an official despite so much hype. I went to join a league called RVS and became friends with their owner (he is now a TSF staff) and I started to get into refereeing and enjoyed it genuinely and then we merged with a couple of other leagues and became an MMP league, it was my first real experience of owning a league as it didn't need a lot of demand. However it bought me into so many sitations such as admin abuse and corruption of the league and I threatened to leave and get everyone to leave. But im not going into full detail of that situation, that can save for another time. 

# __CFL, and its eventual merge to the TSF we know today__

Amongst these side TRS leagues, I joined CFL and signed for a team however corruption within the team saw me and my teammates walk out on our manager, and I didn't touch CFL since then, however one day Tactical Triumph announces that they are merging with CFL and a couple of other leagues to make the official league of TRS, TSF and I would join it and became a Referee during PRE SEASON 1 and reffed a number of games, however once we got to the middle of SEASON 1 the league activity dropped, ownership became instable and after the TSF Cup final, SEASON 1 was ended however SEASON 2 would not start until 2 months later during that time I was very active hosting scrims and then we kept calling on the current President at the time, Paintballshido to release staff apps and when he eventually did, I felt like I was ready to take on the challenge and I applied for it, 24 hours later I became a Trial Staff.
